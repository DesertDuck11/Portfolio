# About This Game

Cthulhu & Me is a 3D third-person roguelike boomer-shooter where, on a bright sunny day, Cthulhu rises from the ocean to terrorize the world once again, but notices and takes interest in a little girl who is seemingly not afraid of this eldritch being. 

Play as this little girl in the world of dreams, her dreams. Battle monstrosities and terrors created by Cthulhu as you navigate through a maze of randomized
rooms while collecting a variety of imaginary weapons such as the legendary crayon shotgun.
